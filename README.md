# RDT-Simulator
(Reliable Data Transfer Simulator)
*Original Repo privated

With a given 'NetworkSimulator' class, this project involved the implementation of a stop and wait reliable data transfer protocol. It required my group's understanding of the concept of an RDT protocol and how this can be pipelined for efficiency. The goal was to implement the functionality of sending and receiving packets, acknowledgements, recognising when timeouts occur if a packet has been lost, and handling corruption. The first stage was implemented to accommodate only one packet at a time, whereas the second iteration was adapted to use pipelining when transfering packets.

I was responsible for implementing starting and stopping of timers for the appropriate parts of the code, as well as assisting in debugging the code as a group during Zoom calls.
